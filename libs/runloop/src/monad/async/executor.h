/*! \brief EXPENSIVE Creates an executor instance. You must create it on the
 kernel thread where it will be used.

Generally, one also needs to create context switcher instances for each
executor instance. This is because the context switcher needs to store how
to resume the executor when a task's execution suspends.

You can optionally create an io_uring instance for the executor by setting
`attr->io_uring_ring.entries` to non-zero. This will then be used to dispatch
work instead of an internal dispatcher.

You may additionally optionally create a second io_uring instance called
"write ring" by setting `attr->io_uring_wr_ring.entries` to non-zero. This
is mandatory if you wish to write to files, otherwise it is not used.

The reason a special io_uring instance is used for operations which modify
files is because a total sequentially consistent order is applied to all file
write operations. This implements a "multi-copy atomic" memory model similar
to that used by ARM microprocessors. This is a weak memory model, but one
sufficient to prevent:

1. Write amplification on the device caused by multiple concurrent writes.

2. Writes appearing to readers not in the order of write submission.

The most efficient way of implementing this weak memory model is a specially
configured io_uring instance, so this is why we have that.

Do NOT use the "write ring" for writes to sockets, it will severely impact
performance!

`monad_async_executor_wake()`, there being write i/o pending (as then two
rings need to be checked), and the usual spurious early timeouts from Linux.

to only do that processing if the value returned is not zero.
